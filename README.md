I did the challenge with the Python language.
In order to make the tables, I wanted to make lists upon lists, so that I can iterate over each element. The element would be the day, with the entry and exit times of each employee.
Once I entered all the data and created the lists, I created the 'equal' function to compare two lists, and find elements that are equal.
For each element that is equal, the 'times' variable is incremented. This variable is the one that will print the times that each employee coincides.
To run the program you must copy and paste the file into your IDE, and run.
