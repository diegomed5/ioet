I did the challenge with the Python language.
In order to make the tables, I wanted to make lists upon lists, so that I can iterate over each element. The element would be the day, with the entry and exit times of each employee.
Once I entered all the data and created the lists, I created the 'equal' function to compare two lists, and find elements that are equal.
For each element that is equal, the 'times' variable is incremented. This variable is the one that will print the times that each employee coincides.
To run the program you must copy and paste the file into your IDE, and run.

-------
The second version I made has the difference that it asks for input for each day of the week, from each employee. the value requested is in 'float'. the values are stored in each initial empty list. at the end of the orders a list of lists has been created. which will then be iterated element by element with the 'equal' function. and the result on the screen will be the same.
